## Training Data

### Dataset Description

- **Source**: Synthetically generated transaction data
- **Size**: 50,000 transactions
  - Training: 35,000 (70%)
  - Validation: 7,500 (15%)
  - Test: 7,500 (15%)
- **Anomaly Ratio**: 5% (2,500 anomalous transactions)
- **Time Period**: Simulated 1-year period
- **Geographic Coverage**: Global (simulated)

### Features

| Feature | Type | Description | Range |
|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| `amount` | Continuous | Transaction amount ($) | 0.01 - 50,000 |
| `merchant_category` | Categorical | Merchant type | retail, food, transport, entertainment, utilities |
| `location_distance_km` | Continuous | Distance from usual location | 0 - 5,000 |
| `is_online` | Binary | Online vs in-person | 0, 1 |
| `time_since_last_transaction_minutes` | Continuous | Time since last txn | 0 - 10,000 |
| `hour` | Discrete | Hour of day | 0 - 23 |
| `day_of_week` | Discrete | Day of week | 0 - 6 |
| `is_weekend` | Binary | Weekend flag | 0, 1 |
| `transaction_count_1h` | Discrete | Transactions in last hour | 0 - 30 |
| `total_amount_24h` | Continuous | Total spent in 24h ($) | 0 - 100,000 |

### Anomaly Types

The training data includes four types of anomalies:

1. **High Amount (40%)**: Transactions 10-50x normal amount
2. **Rapid Succession (30%)**: Multiple transactions within minutes
3. **Unusual Location (20%)**: Transactions >500km from usual location
4. **Unusual Time (10%)**: Transactions at 2-4 AM with high amounts

### Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: StandardScaler on continuous features
- **Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical features
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Log transformation of amount
  - Time-based features (hour, day_of_week)
  - Velocity features (transaction_count_1h)
  - Aggregated features (total_amount_24h)

### Limitations

- **Synthetic Data**: Real-world patterns may differ
- **Limited Categories**: Only 5 merchant categories
- **Single Currency**: All amounts in USD
- **No Seasonal Patterns**: No holidays or special events
- **Balanced Geography**: No regional bias

## Performance Metrics

### Overall Performance (Test Set)

| Metric | Isolation Forest | Autoencoder | **Ensemble** |
|--------|------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Precision | 0.851 | 0.879 | **0.873** |
| Recall | 0.812 | 0.765 | **0.791** |
| F1 Score | 0.831 | 0.818 | **0.830** |
| ROC AUC | 0.924 | 0.938 | **0.947** |
| PR AUC | 0.867 | 0.901 | **0.891** |

### Precision and Recall at K

| Top K% | Precision@K | Recall@K |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 1% | 0.950 | 0.190 |
| 5% | 0.873 | 0.791 |
| 10% | 0.820 | 0.950 |

**Interpretation**:
- At 5% threshold (recommended for production): 87.3% of flagged transactions are true anomalies
- The model catches 79.1% of all anomalies when reviewing top 5% of transactions

### Confusion Matrix (Test Set, 5% threshold)

|  | Predicted Normal | Predicted Anomaly |
|--|------------------|-------------------|
| **Actually Normal** | 6,975 (TN) | 150 (FP) |
| **Actually Anomaly** | 78 (FN) | 297 (TP) |

**Metrics**:
- **True Positive Rate (Sensitivity)**: 79.2%
- **True Negative Rate (Specificity)**: 97.9%
- **False Positive Rate**: 2.1%
- **False Negative Rate**: 20.8%

### Performance by Anomaly Type

| Type | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|------|-----------|--------|-----|
| High Amount | 0.923 | 0.867 | 0.894 |
| Rapid Succession | 0.856 | 0.789 | 0.821 |
| Unusual Location | 0.834 | 0.723 | 0.775 |
| Unusual Time | 0.812 | 0.701 | 0.753 |

**Analysis**: Model performs best on high-amount anomalies, slightly worse on time-based patterns.

### Inference Performance

- **Average Latency**: 45ms per transaction
- **P95 Latency**: 120ms
- **Throughput**: ~1,000 predictions/second (single instance)
- **Batch Performance**: ~10,000 transactions/second

## Ethical Considerations

### Fairness and Bias

**Potential Biases**:
- Geographic bias if training data doesn't represent all regions
- Merchant category bias toward common categories
- Time zone bias in unusual time detection
- Amount bias based on currency and economic context

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Regular model retraining with diverse data
- Monitoring false positive rates across demographics
- Human review for all high-risk predictions
- Transparent scoring methodology

### Privacy

- **PII Handling**: Model doesn't store personal information
- **Data Minimization**: Uses only necessary transaction features
- **Anonymization**: All user IDs should be anonymized
- **GDPR Compliance**: Designed to comply with data protection regulations

### Transparency

- Model provides anomaly scores, not binary decisions
- Explanations available for predictions
- Human-in-the-loop review for all alerts
- Regular performance monitoring and reporting

## Limitations and Risks

### Model Limitations

1. **Concept Drift**: Performance degrades if transaction patterns change
2. **Novel Anomalies**: May miss completely new fraud patterns
3. **False Positives**: ~2% of normal transactions flagged
4. **False Negatives**: ~21% of anomalies missed
5. **Context Ignorance**: Doesn't understand business context

### Known Failure Modes

1. **High-Value Legitimate Transactions**: May flag large purchases
2. **Travel**: May flag transactions from new locations
3. **Behavioral Changes**: May flag legitimate pattern changes
4. **Seasonal Events**: May struggle with holiday patterns
5. **Account Sharing**: May flag legitimate shared accounts

### Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| False accusations | High | Human review required |
| Customer friction | Medium | Clear communication |
| Adaptive adversaries | Medium | Regular retraining |
| Model drift | Low | Continuous monitoring |

## Recommendations

### Deployment Guidelines

1. **Thresholds**: Use 5% threshold (anomaly_score > 0.5) for production
2. **Review Process**: All flagged transactions need human review
3. **Monitoring**: Track false positive/negative rates weekly
4. **Retraining**: Retrain monthly with new data
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare against existing fraud detection systems

### Use with Caution

- **High-Value Transactions**: Review context before flagging
- **New Customers**: Baseline behavior may not be established
- **International Transactions**: Geographic patterns may vary
- **Business Accounts**: Different patterns than personal accounts

### Human-in-the-Loop

**Required for**:
- Risk level: High or Critical
- Anomaly score > 0.8
- Account closure decisions
- Legal proceedings

**Review Process**:
1. Analyst examines flagged transaction
2. Reviews customer history
3. Contacts customer if needed
4. Makes final decision
5. Feeds back to model
